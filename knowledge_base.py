    "Nigeria History Overview": """
    Nigeria's history is rich and diverse, spanning millennia from ancient civilizations to its modern nation-state.
    Pre-colonial era: Various sophisticated empires and kingdoms flourished, such as the Nok civilization (5th century BC to 2nd century AD) known for its terracotta sculptures, the Kanem-Bornu Empire (9th-19th century AD) in the North-East, the Hausa city-states (from 11th century AD) in the North, and the Yoruba kingdoms of Ife (11th-15th century) and Oyo (16th-18th century) in the Southwest. The Benin Empire (15th-19th century) in the South-South was renowned for its bronze artistry and extensive trade networks, particularly with the Portuguese who arrived in the late 15th century.
    Colonial Era (19th Century - 1960):
    * **1800s:** The British gradually increased their influence, driven by trade (palm oil, rubber) and the abolition of the slave trade. The Lagos Colony was established in 1861.
    * **1884-1885:** At the Berlin Conference, European powers formally partitioned Africa, and Britain was granted control over the territory that would become Nigeria.
    * **1900:** The Protectorates of Northern and Southern Nigeria were established.
    * **1914:** The Northern and Southern Protectorates were amalgamated by Lord Frederick Lugard, forming the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. This act unified diverse ethnic groups under a single colonial administration, laying the foundation for the modern Nigerian state.
    * **Mid-20th Century:** A growing nationalist movement emerged, with key figures like Nnamdi Azikiwe, Obafemi Awolowo, and Ahmadu Bello advocating for self-governance.

    Independence and Post-Independence:
    * **October 1, 1960:** Nigeria gained full independence from British rule, becoming a federation. Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa became the first Prime Minister.
    * **1963:** Nigeria became a republic, with Nnamdi Azikiwe as its first President.
    * **1966:** Two military coups occurred, leading to widespread unrest and ethnic tensions.
    * **1967-1970:** The Nigerian Civil War (Biafran War) erupted when the Eastern Region seceded, forming the Republic of Biafra. The war resulted in millions of deaths, primarily from starvation, and ended with Biafra's reintegration into Nigeria.
    * **1970-1979:** A period of military rule followed the civil war, marked by an oil boom, but also corruption and political instability.
    * **1979-1983:** The Second Republic, a brief return to civilian rule under President Shehu Shagari, ended with another military coup.
    * **1983-1999:** A protracted period of military dictatorships, including the regimes of Muhammadu Buhari, Ibrahim Babangida, and Sani Abacha. This era was characterized by human rights abuses, economic hardship, and political repression, including the annulment of the 1993 presidential election results.
    * **1999:** A transition to democratic civilian rule occurred with the election of Olusegun Obasanjo as President, marking the beginning of the Fourth Republic. This ushered in a period of sustained democracy, though challenges like corruption, insecurity, and economic diversification persist.

    Nigerians all, and proud to serve
    Our sovereign Motherland.

    Our flag shall be a symbol
    That truth and justice reign,
    In peace or battle honour'd,
    And this we count as gain,
    To hand on to our children
    A banner without stain.

    O God of all creation,
    Grant this our one request,
    Help us to build a nation
    Where no man is oppressed,
    And so with peace and plenty,
    Nigeria may be blessed.
